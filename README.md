Getting started with computer vision 

the roadmap to learning computer vision : 

learn intro to neural networks, loss function, optimizers, gradient descent, sgd, Adagrad, RMSProp, Adam

ann ---> image processing
	 cnn


transfer leasrning eg : alexnet, vgg16, vgg19, resnet

obj. detection : RCNN, SSD, YOLO

deployment projects




***opencv
***tensorflow
***pytorch
